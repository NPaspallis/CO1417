# Analysis of 5-letter English words

Read the words in the [../step0905/words_5_letters.txt](../step0905/words_5_letters.txt) file.
Then perform an analysis to find the frequency of each of the letters ``a`` to ``z``.

        The frequency is how many times each letter appears in the list of words. For instance, for the list ['hello',
        'world'], the frequencies are: {'d': 1, 'e': 1, 'h': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, 'r': 1, w': 1}.

1. Write a program which prints the frequencies for each letter in a list as follows (fictional numbers shown as indication):

```text
a: 123
b: 92
c: 107
...
e: 147
...
y: 89
z: 23
```

2. Write a program which prints the frequencies for each letter, but this time, order the letters by frequency, e.g.:

```text
e: 147
a: 123
...
z: 23
```
