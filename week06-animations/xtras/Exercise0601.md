# Exercise 0601 - Drawing on the canvas

Revisit the code from ``step0601``, [image_viewer.py](../step0601/image_viewer.py).

1. Aim to move the drawn image to the top-left corner of the window.
Your answer should modify only the `canvas.create_image()` line.


    Hint: You can use the python_logo.img.width() and python_logo.img.height() functions to get the dimensions of the loaded image.

2. Aim to move the image to the bottom-right corner. Again, your answer should only edit the
`canvas.create_image()` line.
