# Welcome to CO1417 - Explorations in Computing.
# This module uses Python.
# To add comments, simply use the '#' (hash) character.

# You can run code directly - no need to enclose in a class or a main function, etc.
# To run the code in this file, simply press the green 'play' button at the top left of this editor window
# (next to line '1').
# Alternatively, you can run a file by right-clicking in the editor area and selecting 'Run <file name>'.

# As you can imagine, the 'print' command simply prints something to the console.
# Note that the statements do not need (or allow) a line terminator (unlike Java which requires the semicolon ';')
print("Hello World!")

# In the lab code you will often find comments marked with the keyword todo.
# These call for your attention. They normally ask you to complete a step/task.

# todo Edit the code below to personalize the greeting!
print("Hi from Nearchos!")

# Solution: Simply replace 'Nearchos' with your name. Run the program to verify it works.
