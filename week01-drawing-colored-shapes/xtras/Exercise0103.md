# Exercise 0103

Create a program to draw all squares with sides 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 110, etc. - i.e. their side is a *prime number*
multiplied by 10. The squares must be centered at the center of a window with size 800x600.
You must use the *for loop*.
You can terminate the loop at 80*10.

You must define a function named `is_prime(x)` which takes as input an integer `x`, checks if it is prime or not, and
returns a `Boolean` value (`True`/`False`) accordingly.
You must use the function `is_prime` to decide whether the side you are checking must be used to draw a square or not.

See this image for what the output is expected to be like:
