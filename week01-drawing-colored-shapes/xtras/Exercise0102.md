# Exercise 0102

Create a program to draw all squares with sides 100, 110, 120, ..., 300, centered at the center of a window with size 800x600.
You must use the *for loop*, possibly with the *range* option.

See this image for what the output is expected to be like:

Hints:
- This is nearly identical as the previous exercise, but you need to use for loop rather than while loop
- See: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp
- Again, you can use `canvas.create_rectangle(left, top, right, bottom)` where left, top, right, bottom are the
coordinates of the left-top and right-bottom corners of the rectangle to be drawn
