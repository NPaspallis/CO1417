# Create a program to draw all squares with sides 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 110, etc. - i.e. their side is a prime number
# multiplied by 10.
# You must use the 'for' loop, possibly with the 'range' option to generate the side values: 1*10, 2*10, 3*10, 4*10,
# etc. See: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp
# You can terminate the loop at 80*10.
# You must define a function name is_prime() which takes as input an integer, checks if it is prime or not, and
# returns a Boolean value (True/False) accordingly. See here for examples of functions with return values:
# https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp
# You must use function 'is_prime' to decide whether the side you are checking must be used to draw a square or not.
# You can learn about using 'if' and 'if-else' conditionals in Python, by looking at the examples here:
