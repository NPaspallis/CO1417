# Create a program to draw all squares with sides 100, 110, 120, ..., 300, centered at the center of a window with
# size 800x600.
# You must use the 'for' loop, possibly with the 'range' option, see:
# https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp
# You can reuse the 'draw_square' function defined earlier.
