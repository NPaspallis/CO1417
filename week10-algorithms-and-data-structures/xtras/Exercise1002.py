# Create a Deck of cards as a List. Each card should be a Tuple (Suit and Value)
# The valid Suits are: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades.
# The valid Values are: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King.

# TODO 1 Create the Deck as a List and print it (it should be sorted)

# TODO 2 Create a Dictionary where all the cards are keys, and the values are any of 4 players: 'P1', 'P2', 'P3', and 'P4'.
#   Allocate the cards so that each player is assigned to an equal number of cards in a random manner.
#   Print the name and the cards for each player (first the cards of P1, then of P2, etc.)

# TODO 3 Create a Dictionary where the players 'P1', ..., 'P4' are the keys, and the values are lists containing all
#   the cards in their hands.
