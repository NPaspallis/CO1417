# Exercise 1004

Review the code from [step1002](../step1002/readme.md) as needed. Then answer the following:

For a given list of numbers ``positives_and_negatives = [10, -4, 13, -14, -19, 27, -5, -8, -10, 20]``:

1. Write code using loops and conditionals to produce a list containing only the negative values
``[-4, -14, -19, -5, -8, -10]``
2. Solve the same problem as above, but use List Comprehension instead of loops and conditionals.
3. Write code using loops and conditionals to produce the equivalent list ``abs1`` which contains the absolute values
``[10, 4, 13, 14, 19, 27, 5, 8, 10, 20]``
4. Solve the same problem as above, but use List Comprehension instead of loops and conditionals.
5. Given the list ``['avocado', 'beetroot', 'cucumber', 'eggplant', 'fava bean', 'garlic', 'lettuce', 'onion', 'potato',
'radish', 'tomato', 'yam', 'zucchini']``, select all items which start with a vowel -- assume vowels are: a, e, i, o, u.

        Hint: You can select the first letter of a String using the ``[0]`` operator. E.g. ``'abcd'[0]`` returns `a`.
