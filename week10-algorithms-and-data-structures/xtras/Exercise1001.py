# TODO 1. for the following list of cities, print them one-by-one, in new lines

cities = ['Nicosia', 'Athens', 'London', 'New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Rio', 'Cape Town', 'Tokyo', 'Sydney', 'Beijing']

# TODO 2. repeat step 1, but now precede each city by a sequence number starting with 1. I.e. '1. Nicosia, 2. Athens, ...'

# TODO 3. repeat step 2, but this time sort the cities first.
#   Note that Python has built-in sort functionality. Look it up on Google.

# TODO 4. again repeat step 2, but this time randomly shuffle the cities first.
#   Note that Python has built-in functionality for randomly shuffling a list. Look it up on Google.
