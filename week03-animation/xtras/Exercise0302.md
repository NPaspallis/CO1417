# Exercise 0302

Copy-paste the code from `Collisions.py` to a new program. Then modify it so that when any two balls *collide*,
the smaller of the two (i.e., smaller radius) is removed from the window.
***But*** the remaining (larger) ball is enlarged (i.e., its radius is increased by as much as the smaller\'s radius).
Effectively this will result to the illusion of the larger ball *absorbing* the smaller one.
