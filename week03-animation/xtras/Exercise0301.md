# Exercise 0301

Copy-paste the code from `Collisions.py` to a new program. Then modify it so that when any two balls *collide*,
the smaller of the two (i.e., smaller radius) is removed from the window.

Hint:
- Two balls collide when the distance between their centres is smaller than the sum of their radius.
