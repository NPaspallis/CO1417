# Exercise 0705 - Flappy wings game

Depends on [Exercise0704](Exercise0704.md).

Revisit the code from ``step0704``, [adding_obstacles.py](../step0704/adding_obstacles.py).

1. Implement a Flappy wings game by integrating the *flappy wings* animation, and its animation, as
described in [week06](../../week06-animations).

It is suggested that you use the smaller *Flappy wings* frames (under the [flappy-wings/](flappy-wings) folder).

The final code would implement something similar to the following animation:

2. *Optionally*, implement additional game elements, like a *Score* label, and a *Game Over* feature
(i.e., lose when *flappy wings* touches an obstacle).
