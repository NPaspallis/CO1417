# Exercise 0701 - Reset the background image

Revisit the code from ``step0701``, [moving_background.py](../step0701/moving_background.py).

The background image is gradually shifted to the left, to form the illusion of movement.

However, when the background image falls out of the screen, the animation ends.

Aim to move add code so that when the background image is out of the left edge of the screen, it reenters
from the right edge.
