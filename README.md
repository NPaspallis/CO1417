Source code for the lab worksheets of "CO1417 Explorations in Computing"
of the [BSc Hons Computing](http://computing.uclancyprus.ac.cy) Programme at [UCLan Cyprus](https://uclancyprus.ac.cy).

## Section 1 - Software and Visualization

### Week 1 - Drawing colored shapes – squares, rectangles, circles, etc.

Start learning about Python and its graphical environment.

Uses a graphical approach, rather than a text-based one, for introducing basic programming concepts:
- Printing in the console
- Creating, showing, and closing a graphical window
- Variables
- Concatenation
- Mathematical operations
- Drawing circles, and lines
- Functions
- Loops and Nested Loops

### Week 2 - Interacting with shapes

Advances the use of the graphical environment, and covers event-driven programming:
- Handling input from the keyboard (individual button presses)
- Handling input from the mouse (move and button clicks)
- More on drawing shapes
- Tuples

### Week 3 - Basic animations – making shapes move

Introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. Also covers animation loops:
- Simple animation with a loop
- Animation over the X-Y axes
- Showing text on canvas
- Using OOP to write better code
- Handling collisions in animation of objects

### Week 4 - Capstone project: Arkanoid

To sum up section 1, you are asked to develop an [Arkanoid-like game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid).

You can reuse code from the lectures and the exercises.

The exact specification, marking scheme, and hints are provided in the corresponding lab worksheet.

## Games and Graphics

### Week 5 - Images

Provides an introduction to basic image encoding. Explores pixel-by-pixel representation of bitmaps, and uses that
to read and present images from files. It covers these programming concepts:
- Arrays/Lists
- Two-dimensional arrays
- Loops and Nested Loops
- Reading from files
- Basic data transformation

### Week 6 - Character animations

Discusses loading standard image formats such as PNG and GIF.
Uses frame switching to realize simple animations.
Also discusses methods to add interaction to animated characters.
It revises these programming concepts:
- Arrays/Lists
- Loops and Conditionals
- Functions
- Reading from files

### Week 7 - Parallax effect

Applying basic maths and physics into coding.
Realizing a movement illusion, and adding depth utilizing the parallax effect. It revises these core
programming concepts:
- Arrays/Lists
- Loops and Conditionals
- Functions
- Reading from files
- Python ranges
- Random numbers

### Week 8 - Capstone project: Runner game

## Networks and Security
