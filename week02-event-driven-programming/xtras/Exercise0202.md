# Exercise 0202

Create a program to draw a rectangle of width 50 and height 10, positioned at the bottom center of the screen.

Handle mouse input so that the rectangle *follows* the mouse:
- Moving the mouse to the left makes the rectangle move at the same horizontal position.
- Moving the mouse to the right makes the rectangle move at the same horizontal position.
- Clicking the mouse left-button changes the rectangles colour (rotate between your 4 favourite colours).
- The 'x' or 'X' button exits the program.

Make sure to handle the edges: the rectangle should not move outside the left and right bounds of the window.
