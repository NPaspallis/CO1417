# Create a program to a rectangle of width 50 and height 10, positioned at the bottom center of the screen.
# Handle keyboard input so that:
# - moving the mouse to the left moves the rectangle by a corresponding distance to the left,
# - moving the mouse to the right moves the rectangle by a corresponding distance to the right,
# - clicking the mouse left-button changes the rectangles colour (rotate between your 4 favourite colours)
# - the 'x' or 'X' button exits the program.
# Make sure to handle the edges: the rectangle should not move outside the left and right bounds of the screen.
