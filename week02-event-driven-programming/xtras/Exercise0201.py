# Create a program to a rectangle of width 50 and height 10, positioned at the bottom center of the screen.
# Handle keyboard input so that:
# - the left-arrow moves the rectangle 10 pixels left,
# - the right-arrow moves the rectangle 10 pixels right,
# - the 'x' or 'X' button exits the program.
# Make sure to handle the edges: the rectangle should not move outside the left and right bounds of the screen.
