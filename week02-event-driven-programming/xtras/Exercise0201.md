# Exercise 0201

Create a program to draw a rectangle of width 50 and height 10, positioned at the bottom center of the screen.

Handle keyboard input so that:
- The left-arrow moves the rectangle 10 pixels left.
- The right-arrow moves the rectangle 10 pixels right.
- The 'x' or 'X' button exits the program.

Make sure to handle the edges: the rectangle should not move outside the left and right bounds of the window.

Optional:
- Color the rectangle red (or your favorite color)
